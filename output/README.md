# Output Directory

This directory is used to store output files generated by the feature extraction and matching algorithms.

## Output Files

The following files may be generated in this directory:

1. `detection_results.jpg`: Results of object detection in images, showing the original object, matches, and the detected object in the target image.

2. Any other output images or videos generated by the algorithms.

## Notes

- This directory is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to avoid committing large binary files.
- The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist when the code is run.
